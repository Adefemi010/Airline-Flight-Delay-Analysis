# Airline-Flight-Delay-Analysis


### Project Overview
This project takes flight with a deep dive into the intricate world of airline delays, aiming to dissect the factors and trends that lead to flight disruptions. Through a meticulous analysis of delay patterns, I will seek to understand the underlying causes and forecast potential impacts on the airline industry and passenger experiences.

Harnessing the power of advanced analytics, I will navigate through extensive datasets, applying Power BI computational might and SQL's data querying capabilities. My approach will be methodical, ensuring that each step of the analysis is transparent.

Key areas we will scrutinize include:

  1.  Delay Trends: Identifying common timeframes and conditions associated with increased delays.
  2. Carrier Performance: Comparing airline delay records to highlight areas for operational improvement.
  3. Geographical Factors: Examining how different airports and routes are affected by delays.
  4. Seasonal and Weather Influences: Assessing the impact of seasonal variations and weather conditions on flight punctuality.

Our end goal is to elevate industry standards by providing a comprehensive analysis that can lead to more efficient airline operations and an enhanced travel experience for passengers. Join us as we embark on this journey through the clouds, translating data into actionable insights for the airline industry.

This introduction outlines the project's scope and objectives, setting the stage for a detailed exploration of airline flight delays.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial preparation phase, I performed the following task
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Handling duplicate and missing values
  3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Results and Findings
1.  At 872521, Thursday had the highest Total Number of Flights and was 24.55% higher than Saturday, which had the lowest Total Number of Flights at 700545.00.
2.	Thursday accounted for 14.99% of Total Number of Flights.
3.	June in  Delayed made up 10.13% of Total Number of Flights.
4.	At 520718, Jul had the highest Total Number of Flights and was 21.33% higher than Feb, which had the lowest Total Number of Flights at 429191. July accounted for 8.95% of Total Number of Flights.
5.	Early had the highest Total Number of Flights at 3277948.00, followed by Delayed, Ontime, and No Record. Early accounted for 56.33% of Total Number of Flights.
6.	Total Number of Flights for No (5729195.00) was higher than Yes (89884.00). No accounted for 98.46% of Total Number of Flights.
7.	Weather had the highest Sum of Cancelled Flight at 48851, followed by Airline/Carrier, National Air System, and Security. Weather accounted for 54.35% of Sum of Cancelled Flight.
8.	At 366770.00, Chicago had the highest Total Number of Flights and was 88.40% higher than Los Angeles, which had the lowest Total Number of Flights at 194673. 
9.	At 366770.00, Chicago had the highest Total Number of Flights and was 1,078,635.29% higher than Ithaca, which had the lowest Total Number of Flights at 34. Chicago accounted for 6.88% of Total Number of Flights.

### Recomendations
1.	Increase the number of flights on Saturdays to balance the distribution of flights throughout the week, considering Thursday has the highest total number of flights.
2.	Evaluate the demand and profitability of flights on Thursdays to ensure that the higher number of flights is justified by passenger numbers and revenue.
3.	Analyze the factors contributing to June having a higher percentage of delayed flights and implement strategies to mitigate these delays during this month.
4.	Consider increasing the number of flights in February to match the higher demand in July, which has the highest total number of flights.
5.	Investigate why a significant majority of flights are early and develop strategies to utilize this advantage, such as promoting the airline's punctuality in marketing campaigns.
6.	Review the operational processes that lead to flights being early to ensure that this does not negatively impact customer satisfaction or resource utilization.
7.	Implement more robust weather forecasting and monitoring systems to better anticipate and manage flight cancellations due to weather.
8.	Develop contingency plans, such as flexible rebooking options and partnerships with other carriers, to minimize passenger inconvenience during weather-related disruptions.
9.	Given Chicago's high total number of flights, ensure that the airport infrastructure is scaled to handle the traffic efficiently and to maintain a high level of service.
10.	Analyze the operational flow in Chicago to identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies that could be improved to handle the high volume of flights.
11.	Investigate why Los Angeles has a significantly lower number of flights compared to Chicago despite being a major city and consider increasing flight frequency if there is unmet demand.
12.	Evaluate the distribution of flights across different airports to optimize network efficiency and profitability, considering the extreme variance between cities like Chicago and Ithaca.
